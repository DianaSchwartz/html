		<td class="font"><b>A bit of history</b><br>
The city was founded more than 1,000 years ago by the Mongols (Tatars) of the Golden Horde 
after their overthrow of the Bulgar kingdom on the middle Volga.
In 1438, Kazan became the capital of the Khanate of Kazan (Tatar Turkic state). 
In 1552, Kazan was captured by Ivan the Terrible and became a part of Russia.<br>
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kazan stayed as the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan.
Kazan became one of the most important centers of the Russian Federation.<br>
The city earned the right to host both the 2013 Summer Universiade, 
2018 FIFA World Cup and also the 45th Worldskills Competition was held in Kazan on 2019. </td>

		<td class="font"><b>About a climate</b><br>
In Kazan, the summers are comfortable and partly cloudy and the winters are long, freezing, snowy, windy, and overcast.<br> 
Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from -15째C to 25째C and is rarely below -22째C or above 32째C.<br>
the best time of year to visit Kazan for warm-weather activities is from late June to mid August.<br>
But if you want to breathe fresh frosty air, play snowballs, go skiing, skating or snowbording, 
I highly recommend going to Kazan in winter!
